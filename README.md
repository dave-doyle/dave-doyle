## Hello World 👋 Dave here


Welcome to my GitHub profile!
    
    💻 Most recently: Working as a software developer building AI-powered applications integrating LLMs with IoT devices.
    ⚡ Tech I use daily: React (TypeScript), Python (FastAPI), LangChain, AWS (Lambda, Cognito, Bedrock, CodeArtifact), GCP, MongoDB.
    🤖 LLM Experience: Prompt engineering with ChatGPT, Claude (Haiku & Sonnet), Jinja2 templating, LiteLLM, MCP, and RAG pipelines for document retrieval.
    🌱 Currently exploring: Deploying local LLMs on edge hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Orin) — experimenting with model optimization, quantization, and LoRA fine-tuning to enable real time efficiency.
       Also investigating graph based approaches for AI agent context and memoery retrieval.
    👯 Open to collaborate on: Projects in AI/LLMs, full-stack web apps, and cloud-native solutions.

I’m passionate about turning ideas into production-ready software, with a focus on AI integration, cloud deployment, and developer tooling. Always happy to connect, share knowledge, or work on interesting open-source projects.
